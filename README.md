# Facebook Pop Sample Application
Originally made for students in my General Assembly Mobile Development class, this project is meant to give a basic introduction to Facebook Pop usage. It also has one CABasicAnimation with a 3D rotation in it.

## How to install?
You'll need cocoapods pre right now as this is written in Swift. There are two dependencies:
- Snap for easier layout constraints
- Facebook Pop

To install just run `pod install` and use the xcworkspace file
